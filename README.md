# docker-zigbee2mqtt

My setup for [zigbee2mqtt](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt), for `armhf` and `x86_64`

This requires [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu) to build the images.

# DEPRECATION WARNING

Please use [the official Docker image instead](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/tree/master/docker), since that now has multi-architecture support.
